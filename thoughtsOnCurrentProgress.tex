Is it possible that the only cases that I need to re-run are the case of tilt angle equals 45.00 deg. and 67.50 deg. This is possible because the case of 00.00 deg. is already alright and can be easily explained. So too is the case of tilt angle 90.00 deg., which is basically the simulated version of a setup whose experimental data exists.

The data for tilt angle 22.50 deg. is alright, since we can easily explain the trend found in the data too. Perhaps I only need to re-run the cases where the freestream velocity is equal to 0.9 m/s and 1.0 m/s, since the root-mean-square amplitude of the total lift force is somehow bigger for the case of 22.50 deg. at 0.9 m/s and 1.0 m/s, compared to 00.00 deg.

But the cases of 45.00 deg. and 67.50 deg. are hard to explain since the vibration amplitude is similar for both cases past the KVIV lower branch, although the contribution to the total lift that is in-phase with the cylinder displacement is far smaller for the case of 45.00 deg.

For the most part, the asymmetry that was present in the cylinder displacement signal when 45.00 deg. is gone with the revised mesh. The revised mesh changes the distribution of cells in the plate domain of the simulation by deploying a higher concentration of cells nearby the circular cylinder neutral position.
